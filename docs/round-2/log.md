# Log - Round 2

## Day 0: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Took care of some housekeeping like coming up with a plan of action & setting up a repo for my log (will be using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) for this). Now this #100DaysOfCode can begin!

**Thoughts:** The basis of this whole process was to ensure that would not be bogged by the mundane tasks of planning my work and setting up a structure for my repositiries. This will ensure that once I start I will be more focused on the task at hand.

## Day 1: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Worked through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning foundational concepts in any programming language is always great because it assesses how well you understand them. So even though a lot of the exercises I did today were quite easy it was great revisiting these topics.

## Day 2: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section. Completed the exercises concerning compound assignment and string variables.

**Thoughts:** At the point none of the exercises are challenging as it is concepts that I already know but it is still great preparation to tackle more complex concepts and complete the projects.

## Day 3: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Array exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** It was refreshing to revisit the declaration and manipulation of arrays, as it is a concept that no only applies to a lot of concepts going forward in the certification, but also as part of my actual job.

## Day 4: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Function exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section, which included implementing a simple queue.

**Thoughts:** Even though freeCodeCamp is a great resource, it does however all the topics in concise and easily manageable modules so inorder to learn something in its entirety I will have to invest time into other resources such as books, video tutorials and coding exercises.

## Day 5: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript. Covered implementing conditional logic through comparison operators and conditional statements. And also learnt a bit about golf, through an exercise that simplified the logic for the scoring process.

**Thoughts:** May have to overhaul my schedule to find adequate time for #100DaysOfCode. Because at present most of my sessions are late at night and this means I get to bed to late. This ultimately means, I wake up tired and decrease my overall productivity for the day.
