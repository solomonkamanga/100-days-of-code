# Log - Round 2

## Day 0: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Took care of some housekeeping like coming up with a plan of action & setting up a repo for my log (will be using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) for this). Now this #100DaysOfCode can begin!

**Thoughts:** The basis of this whole process was to ensure that would not be bogged by the mundane tasks of planning my work and setting up a structure for my repositiries. This will ensure that once I start I will be more focused on the task at hand.

## Day 1: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Worked through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning foundational concepts in any programming language is always great because it assesses how well you understand them. So even though a lot of the exercises I did today were quite easy it was great revisiting these topics.

## Day 2: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section. Completed the exercises concerning compound assignment and string variables.

**Thoughts:** At the point none of the exercises are challenging as it is concepts that I already know but it is still great preparation to tackle more complex concepts and complete the projects.
