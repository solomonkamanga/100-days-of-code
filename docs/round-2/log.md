# Log - Round 2

## Day 0: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Took care of some housekeeping like coming up with a plan of action & setting up a repo for my log (will be using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) for this). Now this #100DaysOfCode can begin!

**Thoughts:** The basis of this whole process was to ensure that would not be bogged by the mundane tasks of planning my work and setting up a structure for my repositories. This will ensure that once I start I will be more focused on the task at hand.

## Day 1: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Worked through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning foundational concepts in any programming language is always great because it assesses how well you understand them. So even though a lot of the exercises I did today were quite easy it was great revisiting these topics.

## Day 3: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Array exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** It was refreshing to revisit the declaration and manipulation of arrays, as it is a concept that no only applies to a lot of concepts going forward in the certification, but also as part of my actual job.

## Day 4: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Function exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section, which included implementing a simple queue.

**Thoughts:** Even though freeCodeCamp is a great resource, it does however only have the topics in concise and easily manageable modules so in order to learn something in its entirety I will have to invest time into other resources such as books, video tutorials and coding exercises.

**Link to work:** [Day 4 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1229117170585612295)

## Day 5: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript. Covered implementing conditional logic through comparison operators and conditional statements. And also learnt a bit about golf, through an exercise that simplified the logic for the scoring process.

**Thoughts:** May have to overhaul my schedule to find adequate time for #100DaysOfCode. Because at present most of my sessions are late at night and this means I get to bed to late. This ultimately means, I wake up tired and decrease my overall productivity for the day.

**Link to work:** [Day 5 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1229536859061202944)

## Day 6: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed exercises on switch statements (Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)) and wrote a card counting function for Blackjack. 

**Thoughts:** As I progress through Basic JavaScript, the exercises are getting more challenging. Especially the final exercises, which is a great test of the knowledge I would have acquired through the previous exercises and my overall understanding of JavaScript.

**Link to work:** [Day 6 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1229899633629028352)

## Day 7: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the exercises for JavaScript Objects(Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)). Did not complete the final exercise, which was writing a function for a record collection.  Will do that in my next coding session.

**Thoughts:** Even though JavaScript Objects was a particularly challenging topic I greatly enjoyed today's session despite not completing the final exercise. I am happy that even after a particularly long day at work I still managed to find time for my coding session. And in future, there is a great possibility that I will have many such days, and as much as being dedicated to the challenge is quite important to me I also need to understand when to take breaks or stop for the day.

**Link to work:** [Day 7 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1230264655207071744)

## Day 8: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished working on the record collection function (Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)). And also worked on the Loop exercises.

**Thoughts:** Working on this challenge has definitely helped and will continue to help me revisit the theory behind the programming concepts I use on a daily basis at work, which will definitely improve my understanding.

**Link to work:** [Day 8 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1230605543968038913)

## Day 9: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Profile Lookup function. Also worked on the exercises for generating random numbers, recursion and ternary operators. So I have now completed the Basic JavaScript section ([freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)).

**Thoughts:** Even though I have completed Basic JavaScript, a lot of the topics covered in this section are quite foundational to having a great understanding of JavaScript, so I will have to keep revisiting them as I continue through the certification. This will ensure that I have a great grasp of these concepts and can use them effectively.

## Day 10: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on the exercises for learning about the features of ES6 on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). 

**Thoughts:** Going into this #100DaysOfCode challenge I was quite unsure I would be able to commit time on the weekend for coding sessions but I am quite happy with my progress so far. Because weekends are usually the time I rest after a week at work and I am not always motivated to do any work.

**Link to work:** [Day 10 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1231336589365858304)

## Day 11: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) exercises from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** My introduction to ES6 concepts was not as smooth as I had hoped. Some of the concepts have quite a steep learning curve and I had to re-evaluate my learning process. The re-evaluation was just to ensure that my main focus is not retaining copious amounts of information but understanding the ES6 concepts enough to be able to use them when writing actual code.

## Day 12: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked through about half of the exercises in the Regular Expressions chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Regular expressions are an interesting concept and I cannot wait to see the various use cases I can use them when writing code. However, today was somewhat a difficult day because I felt overwhelmingly tired and at times it seemed as if I was doing everything on autopilot, and I was not truly engaged in what I was doing. I think one of the ways I can fix this is by taking more frequent breaks during coding sessions.

**Link to work:** [Day 12 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1232002181894721536)

## Day 13: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Regular Expressions challenges from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Writing short notes during my coding or learning sessions means I take longer to complete a particular task but I believe it will definitely be worth it in the long term. Because it really helps with my understanding and retention of the concepts that I am learning. 

**Link to work:** [Day 13 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1232407945566134273)

## Day 14: February 26, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Worked through all of the Debugging exercises on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** After about 2 weeks of working on this challenge I am happy with the results so far. Because I believe I am learning quite a lot and improving my skills in a significant way. However, there are still aspects I can improve on such as doing more practical exercises and being more consistent with my note taking during sessions.

**Link to work:** [Day 14 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1232751938208436225)

## Day 15: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent today's session reading Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book. Focused mainly on the concepts I have covered so far through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) exercises; such as data types, operators and expressions (Chapter 2) & functions, model and objects (Chapter 3).

**Thoughts:** Coupling the practical aspects of following the freeCodeCamp curriculum and my own will work to enhance the knowledge that I will have at the end of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**Link to work:** [Day 15 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1233136574344441857)

## Day 16: February 28, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Completed half of the challenges in the Basic Data Structures chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Apart from the actual coding, I also read a bit more of Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book and watched some videos in the JavaScript Essentials Training course from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training-3/). Also finally made an schedule using [My Study Life](https://www.mystudylife.com/). It is a platform that has a web app and a mobile app that allows me keep track of all my tasks.

## Day 17: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the remaining challenges in the Basic Data Structures chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Today was a pretty hard to session to get through because I felt overwhelmingly tired but I just had to push through because I was genuinely enjoying what I was learning despite the fatigue.

**Link to work:** [Day 17 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1233791717494657025)

## Day 18: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the following algorithms from Basic Algorithms Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Reverse a String
- Factorize a Number
- Find the Longest Word in a String
- Return Largest Numbers in Arrays

**Thoughts:** Overall it was a very productive weekend. It was not all entirely focused on coding but also learning new concepts through following courses on LinkedIn, reading books and making notes to gauge my understanding of the material.

**Link to work:** [Day 18 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1234136246374535169)

## Day 19: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). And I was only able to complete one of the algorithms:
- Confirm the Ending

**Thoughts:** I actually wrote down the pseudocode for the function I wanted to write and did a dry run on paper. This allowed me to assess the plausibility of the logic that I wanted to implement. I was reminded of this simplistic way of designing scripts when I was reading Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) (Page 16). I love how it really helps me figure out if I understood what the challenge entails and if my logic/function fulfils the specifications of the challenge.

## Day 20: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Wrote functions for the following challenges in Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):
- Repeat a String Repeat a String
- Truncate a String

**Thoughts:** Being able to instinctively write JavaScript functions based on what I have actually learnt, with only occasional references to my notes or a textbook, is a refreshing feeling. It gives me the confidence to tackle more complex problems in future.

## Day 21: March 4, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on Basic Algorithm Scripting ([freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)) and I wrote functions for the following challenges:
- Finders Keepers
- Boo who
- Title Case a Sentence
- Slice and Splice

**Thoughts:** Even though coding after a long day is hard, I like how it has become part of my daily routine and is no longer a burden I have to overcome at the end of each day.

## Day 22: March 5, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Finally completed Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Wrote functions for the following challenges: 
- Falsy Bouncer
- Where do I Belong
- Mutations
- Chunky Monkey

**Thoughts:** Through working on the algorithm challenges from the Basic Algorithm Scripting section, I have realised that my understanding of JavaScript concepts has definitely improved. And I am much more comfortable when analysing problems, designing the required script and ultimately writing the code to solve the problem.

## Day 23: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Object Oriented Programming on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and completed the first few challenges.

**Thoughts:** The issues with having a balance between life and coding is always more evident during the weekend because I always struggle to find time to dedicate to the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

**Link to work:** [Day 23 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1236300696078729216)

## Day 24: March 8, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Continued working on Object Oriented Programming from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Focused on defining, using and verifying constructors.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I genuinely do not understand the concepts being explained in some of the challenges so I just have to hope that: "Long term consistency beats short term intensity".

**Link to work:** [Day 24 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1236652574822055936)

## Day 25: March 9, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on Object Oriented Programming on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Today I worked on the following properties: 
1. own
2. prototype
3. constructor
Have now covered about half of the challenges in the section. 

**Thoughts:** The concepts in object oriented programming are quite confusing but I am starting to understand a bit more. Not only by following the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum, but also videos on LinkedIn Learning and doing some research on the internet. 

**Link to work:** [Day 25 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1237135651897819137)

## Day 26: March 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed Object Oriented Programming on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Most of the challenges were focused on enhancing my understanding of constructors and prototypes.

**Thoughts:** Majority of the concepts in Object Oriented Programming are not something that can be fully understood and learnt in one seating. These topics will have to be continually revisited in future, especially when I have to use them in code.

**Link to work:** [Day 26 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1237484167639830534)

## Day 27: March 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started Functional Programming on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). And chapter seems to contain a substantial amount of theory.

**Thoughts:** When it comes to learning about coding I have always preferred the practical aspects more than the theoretical elements. However, I fully understand that the theory forms the foundation to be able to write great code.

**Link to work:** [Day 27 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1237867613973123072)

## Day 28: March 13. 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working through the Functional Programming challenges on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). And I actually got to use regular expressions(from R2D12 - R2D13) at work. It was just to improve search results on Visual Studio Code but it was still a great experience.

**Thoughts:** One of the most interesting things about undertaking a challenge like #100DaysOfCode at this point in my career is that I actually have a chance to use any new skills in a professional skills. This gives me great practice and ensures that I am more likely to remember the concepts.

## Day 30: March 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the remaining challenges from Functional Programming on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and now I am done with the section.

**Thoughts:** I had to take a 2 day break just to refresh and be away from the challenge for a while, so that I can approach it with new energy. Functional programming has a lot of theory, which means I had to really work hard to ensure sure that I understood the concepts.

**Link to work:** [Day 30 - freeCodecamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1240022009305800704)

## Day 31: March 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). And completed the following algorithms:
- Sum All Numbers in a Range
- Diff Two Arrays
- Seek and Destroy

**Thoughts:** I was honestly apprehensive about starting the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting section, because I was not confident in my understanding of the concepts that I covered in Functional Programming. However, I am quite pleased with my execution of solutions to the challenges so far. I am still referencing the [Mozilla Developer Network Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) whenever I am stuck but at least I do that to verify syntax instead of looking for solutions.

**Link to work:** [Day 31 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1240376526283169796)

## Day 32: March 19, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Continued with Intermediate Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and completed the following algorithms: 
- Wherefore art thou
- Spinal Tap Case
- Pig Latin

**Thoughts:** Despite the increasing difficulty in the challenges I am still comfortable with my execution of the solutions. I have also limited the challenges I attempt every day so that I can truly focus on understanding the concepts involved in solving each challenge.

**Link to work:** [Day 32 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1240746232257171458)

## Day 33: March 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Only managed to write a function for one algorithm: Search and Replace.

**Thoughts:** Some times being set in your ways can be very detrimental to your progress as a person. Today I tried to use a method I was sure would work and I spent about 45 minutes trying to figure out why it wasn't working, only to realize after some time that it was not suited for the particular purpose in my function. A quick Google search would have probably helped me come to this conclusion faster. But hopefully I don't make such mistakes in future.

## Day 34: March 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Another day working on Intermediate Algorithm Scripting from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Wrote functions for:
- DNA Pairing
- Missing letters
- Sorted Union
- Convert HTML Entities
- Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
- Sum All Primes
- Smallest Common Multiple

**Thoughts:** Today's coding session was characterised by doing lots of research on the concepts I have already so as to figure out how to implement the solutions, which really simplified the process. 

**Link to work:** [Day 34 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1241492649410015233)

## Day 35: March 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:**  Finally completed Intermediate Algorithm Scripting ([freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)), after writing functions for the following challenges
- Drop it
- Steamroller
- Binary Agents
- Everything Be True
- Arguments Optional
- Make A Person
- Map the Debris

**Thoughts:** Intermediate Algorithm Scripting was yet another challenge in my journey to improve my JavaScript skills, however I am glad I was able to implement solutions using a majority of the concepts I have learnt thus far.

## Day 36: March 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the 1st project in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects ([freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)): 
- Palindrome Checker 

**Thoughts:** This was the first project in the series of projects I have to complete, so it was fairly easy and it was another great test to gauge my understanding of JavaScript concepts.

**Link to work:** [Day 36 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1242161912491769859)

## Day 37: March 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Wrote for functions for the following challenges: 
- Roman Numeral Converter
- Caesars Cipher

**Thoughts:** Today's challenges were definitely a bit more complicated. But I realised that writing some pseudocode before jumping into writing the JavaScript functions really helped me understand the requirements the solutions had to fulfil.

**Link to work:** [Day 37 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1242563907979485184)

## Day 38: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), and wrote a function for the Telephone Check challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I feel like today's projects was not necessarily about testing one's understanding of JavaScript but about how you can derive meaning from a problem statement, find the requirements and implement a solution. So I think there was more emphasis on the process of developing code rather than the actual code.

## Day 39: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the final project (writing a cash register function) for JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org), so I am FINALLY done with the certification.

**Thoughts:** I am glad to have completed the first goal of my #100DaysOfCode in such a timely manner while also learning a great deal about JavaScript. This leaves more time to try and  prepare for the PHP certification. 

**Link to work:** [Day 39 - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1243264296634716161)

## Day 40: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress:** First day of PHP. Started off by following the PHP learning track on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). And also solved a couple of exercises on [CodeSignal](https://www.codesignal.com).

**Thoughts:** In order to fulfil my goal of preparing for the PHP certification I will be following the PHP Developer learning track on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). And I will also be doing various other tasks to practice my coding skills such as doing exercises on [CodeSignal](https://www.codesignal.com) or [Exercism](https://www.exercism.io).

## Day 41: March 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the PHP Developer Track on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). I'm about halfway through Algorithms (1st course). Decided to use JavaScript to implement linked lists, stacks & queues and hash tables instead of Python. 

**Thoughts:** In order to keep working on my coding skills I will be using JavaScript to implement the coding examples in the [Programming Foundations: Algorithms](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-algorithms) course, instead of using Python.

**Link to work:** [Day 41 - PHP Developer Track](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1244342511654637568)

## Day 42: March 30, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Still working on the Algorithms course in the PHP Developer Track on [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning). Implemented the data structures (linked list, stacks and queues) using JavaScript. The only one left is hash tables. And I put the code on GitHub: [Common Data Structures](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-data-structures).

**Thoughts:** Implementing the data structures in JavaScript was more challenging than I thought it would be even though Python and JavaScript share some syntactical similarities. But after some research I figured out a way to show the same functionality illustrated in the course. The scripts for the data structures can be found in this repository: [Common Data Structures](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-data-structures)

## Day 43: March 31, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished working on implementing a hash table using JavaScript. And also finished the Recursion section in the Algorithms course (PHP Developer Track - [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)). 

**Thoughts:** Writing the script for hash tables using JavaScript really helped me understand how they are implemented and used. This script can be found in the following repository: 
- [Common Data Structures](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-data-structures)

During the recursion section of the course, I implemented the mathematical operations using JavaScript which can be found in the following repository:
- [Common Algorithms](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-algorithms)

## Day 44: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Sorting Data section of the Algorithms course (PHP Developer Track - [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)). Which included implementing scripts for the following algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Repository: [Common Algorithms](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-algorithms)

**Thoughts:** I am almost at the very end of the course and it is definitely taking longer than I anticipated. However, this is not necessarily because I am taking my time to ensure that I have understood all of the concepts being taught, so as to further enhance the knowledge I already have about JavaScript and Algorithms.

## Day 45: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the the Algorithms course (PHP Developer Track - [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning)). But I'm still working on  implementing scripts for:
- Unique filtering with hash table
- Value counting with hash table
- Finding maximum value with recursion

**Thoughts:** Even though I have officially completed the course I have not written scripts for the algorithms in the final section as the problems are proving to be quite challenging. I will have to do some further research and try to complete them in my next coding session.

## Day 46: April 5, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finally got around to completing the scripts for the following algorithms: 
- Unique filtering with hash table
- Value counting with hash table
- Find max value recursively

**Thoughts:** After some research on the internet, I was able to write the scripts that implement the same functionality as the Python scripts from the Algorithms. These algorithms are all available in this repository [Common Algorithms](https://github.com/solomonkamanga/common-algorithms).

## Day 67: May 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Took a "break" from the PHP Developer Track to work on developing a WordPress theme. This was supposed to take a couple of hours at most but now I am tinkering with:
- Creating a simple portfolio website (HTML, CSS & JavaScript)
- Turning this portfolio website into a WordPress Theme

**Thoughts:** Even though this task is taking longer than I anticipated, it's not necessarily a bad thing since I am learning quite a lot in terms of working with WordPress.

## Day 69: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Back at it again! Almost finished working on portfolio website (using HTML, CSS & JavaScript). Just have to fix issues with:
- Light / Dark mode
- Responsive design

**Thoughts:** Apart from abject laziness and disinterest in working on anything code related after work I have no good reasons why I have not been contributing anything to this challenge. However, I am glad that I am back and I can hopefully stick it until the very end.
