# Log - Round 2

## Day 0: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Took care of some housekeeping like coming up with a plan of action & setting up a repo for my log (will be using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) for this). Now this #100DaysOfCode can begin!

**Thoughts:** The basis of this whole process was to ensure that would not be bogged by the mundane tasks of planning my work and setting up a structure for my repositories. This will ensure that once I start I will be more focused on the task at hand.

## Day 1: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress:** I started working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Worked through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** Re-learning foundational concepts in any programming language is always great because it assesses how well you understand them. So even though a lot of the exercises I did today were quite easy it was great revisiting these topics.

## Day 2: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working through the exercises in the Basic JavaScript section. Completed the exercises concerning compound assignment and string variables.

**Thoughts:** At the point none of the exercises are challenging as it is concepts that I already know but it is still great preparation to tackle more complex concepts and complete the projects.

## Day 3: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the Array exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** It was refreshing to revisit the declaration and manipulation of arrays, as it is a concept that no only applies to a lot of concepts going forward in the certification, but also as part of my actual job.

## Day 4: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Function exercises in [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript section, which included implementing a simple queue.

**Thoughts:** Even though freeCodeCamp is a great resource, it does however only have the topics in concise and easily manageable modules so in order to learn something in its entirety I will have to invest time into other resources such as books, video tutorials and coding exercises.

## Day 5: February 17, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) Basic JavaScript. Covered implementing conditional logic through comparison operators and conditional statements. And also learnt a bit about golf, through an exercise that simplified the logic for the scoring process.

**Thoughts:** May have to overhaul my schedule to find adequate time for #100DaysOfCode. Because at present most of my sessions are late at night and this means I get to bed to late. This ultimately means, I wake up tired and decrease my overall productivity for the day.

## Day 6: February 18, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed exercises on switch statements (Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)) and wrote a card counting function for Blackjack. 

**Thoughts:** As I progress through Basic JavaScript, the exercises are getting more challenging. Especially the final exercises, which is a great test of whatever knowledge I would have acquired through the previous exercises and my overall understanding of JavaScript.

## Day 7: February 19, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the exercises for JavaScript Objects(Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)). Did not complete the final exercise, which was writing a function for a record collection.  Will do that in my next coding session.

**Thoughts:** Even though JavaScript Objects was a particularly challenging topic I greatly enjoyed today's session despite not completing the final exercise. I am happy that even after a particularly long day at work I still managed to find time for my coding session. And in future, there is a great possibility that I will have many such days, and as much as being dedicated to the challenge is quite important to me I also need to understand when to take breaks or stop for the day.

## Day 8: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Finished working on the record collection function (Basic JavaScript - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)). And also worked on the Loop exercises.

**Thoughts:** Working on this challenge has definitely helped and will continue to help me revisit the theory behind the programming concepts I use on a daily basis at work, which will definitely improve my understanding.

## Day 9: February 21, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Profile Lookup function. Also worked on the exercises for generating random numbers, recursion and ternary operators. So I have now completed the Basic JavaScript section ([freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)).

**Thoughts:** Even though I have completed Basic JavaScript, a lot of the topics covered in this section are quite foundational to having a great understanding of JavaScript, so I will have to keep revisiting them as I continue through the certification. This will ensure that I have a great grasp of these concepts and can use them effectively.

## Day 10: February 22, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Started on the exercises for learning about the features of ES6 on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). 

**Thoughts:** Going into this #100DaysOfCode challenge I was quite unsure I would be able to commit time on the weekend for coding sessions but I am quite happy with my progress so far. Because weekends are usually the time I rest after a week at work and I am not always motivated to do any work.

**Link to work:** [Day 10 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/1231336589365858304)

## Day 11: February 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) exercises from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** My introduction to ES6 concepts was not as smooth as I had hoped. Some of the concepts have quite a steep learning curve and I had to re-evaluate my learning process. The re-evaluation was just to ensure that my main focus is not retaining copious amounts of information but understanding the ES6 concepts enough to be able to use them when writing actual code.

## Day 12: February 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Worked through about half of the exercises in the Regular Expressions chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Regular expressions are an interesting concept and I cannot wait to see the various use cases I can use them when writing code. However, today was somewhat a difficult day because I felt overwhelmingly tired and at times it seemed as if I was doing everything on autopilot, and I was not truly engaged in what I was doing. I think one of the ways I can fix this is by taking more frequent breaks during coding sessions.

## Day 13: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the Regular Expressions challenges from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Writing short notes during my coding or learning sessions means I take longer to complete a particular task but I believe it will definitely be worth it in the long term. Because it really helps with my understanding and retention of the concepts that I am learning.

## Day 14: February 26, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Worked through all of the Debugging exercises on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** After about 2 weeks of working on this challenge I am happy with the results so far. Because I believe I am learning quite a lot and improving my skills in a significant way. However, there are still aspects I can improve on such as doing more practical exercises and being more consistent with my note taking during sessions.

## Day 15: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Spent today's session reading Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book. Focused mainly on the concepts I have covered so far through [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) exercises; such as data types, operators and expressions (Chapter 2) & functions, model and objects (Chapter 3).

**Thoughts:** Coupling the practical aspects of following the freeCodeCamp curriculum and my own will work to enhance the knowledge that I will have at the end of the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

## Day 16: February 28, 2020

**Today' Progress:** Completed half of the challenges in the Basic Data Structures chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Apart from the actual coding, I also read a bit more of Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) book and watched some videos in the JavaScript Essentials Training course from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training-3/). Also finally made an schedule using [My Study Life](https://www.mystudylife.com/). It is a platform that has a web app and a mobile app that allows me keep track of all my tasks.

## Day 17: February 29, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the remaining challenges in the Basic Data Structures chapter on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Today was a pretty hard to session to get through because I felt overwhelmingly tired but I just had to push through because I was genuinely enjoying what I was learning despite the fatigue.

## Day 18: March 1, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed the following algorithms from Basic Algorithms Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):
- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Reverse a String
- Factorize a Number
- Find the Longest Word in a String
- Return Largest Numbers in Arrays

**Thoughts:** Overall it was a very productive weekend. It was not all entirely focused on coding but also learning new concepts through following courses on LinkedIn, reading books and making notes to gauge my understanding of the material.

## Day 19: March 2, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). And I was only able to complete one of the algorithms:
- Confirm the Ending

**Thoughts:** I actually wrote down the pseudocode for the function I wanted to write and did a dry run on paper. This allowed me to assess the plausibility of the logic that I wanted to implement. I was reminded of this simplistic way of designing scripts when I was reading Jon Duckett's [JavaScript & JQuery](http://www.javascriptbook.com) (Page 16). I love how it really helps me figure out if I understood what the challenge entails and if my logic/function fulfils the specifications of the challenge.

## Day 20: March 3, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Wrote functions for the following challenges in Basic Algorithm Scripting on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org):
- Repeat a String Repeat a String
- Truncate a String

**Thoughts:** Being able to instinctively write JavaScript functions based on what I have actually learnt, with only occasional references to my notes or a textbook, is a refreshing feeling. It gives me the confidence in my own abilities that I will need in order to tackle more complex problems in future.
