# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did about 33% of the **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.

### Day 2: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with my refresher course for HTML on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** Through doing this course I've realized that some of the errors that I face with HTML maybe due to things that I thought I really "knew". It's always refreshing to learn more about something that you already thought you knew a lot about.

### Day 3: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 5 topics in the HTML Common Elements lesson on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I would be finished with the HTML course by now but maybe this steady progress I'm making is for the best. The lessons will probably sink in more and I can be more effective in execution of HTML programming. And I think doing a refresher course on HTML is really going to help me when I start learning Bootstrap in earnest.

### Day 4: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Common Elements lesson on Codecademy, which means I'm done with the Elements and Structure course.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely making more progress with this HTML course. And I've realized I'm more effective when I'm in an environment where I can fully concentrate with minimal distractions. This is something I hadn't seriously considered before cause I didn't even consider that my phone could be a serious distraction.

### Day 5: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Tables lesson on Codecademy meaning I'm officially done with the whole **Learn HTML** course.

**Thoughts:** Being done with HTML course means I can now move on to other topics that I also want to do as part of the challenge such as CSS and JavaScript. I'm genuinely happy with what I learnt as part of this HTML course.

### Day 6: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spent 30 minutes on Codecademy doing the **Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules** and then I spent another 30 minutes on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) doing lessons under the **HTML5/CSS** topic.

**Thoughts:** Doing Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp exercises within the same hour was slightly mentally exhausting. And I think I'd be better off dedicating a full hour to each platform.

### Day 7: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the **CSS Setup and Selectors** interactive lesson in the **Learn CSS** course on Codecademy. It was definitely harder than I thought it'd be. Cause I'm actually supposed to know CSS from when I learnt it in university.

**Thoughts:** CSS can be frustrating. I spent about 10-15 minutes trying to figure out how a style is applied to nested elements. I understand the concept better now. But I think I will truly grasp the concept once I've used it a couple of items.

### Day 8: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm starting to grasp & retain a lot of what I'm learning in the CSS course on Codecademy. I finished the **Visual Rules** lesson. And I'm now done with **CSS Selectors and Visual Rules** section and moving on to **The Box Model** section.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the frustration I had yesterday was mostly due to wondering whether or not I would remember and truly be able to implement some of the concepts I was learning cause it seemed like it was quite a lot at one go. But I'm now focusing on just learning the material for now. And then I can put it into practice later when I work on my personal website or other projects.

### Day 9: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the **The Box Model** and **Changing the Box Model** lessons of the **Learn CSS: The Box Model** course on Codecademy. With what I learnt today in the lesson I could quite possibly create my own CSS file for a website. The CSS file will probably consist of the bare minimum elements.

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of the progress I'm making not only in regards to CSS but also with web development in general. Based on what I've learnt so far I can create my own CSS file that follows the principles of modern web development design.

### Day 10: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed the **Learn CSS: Display and Positioning** lesson on Codecademy. And I'm left with only 2 more lessons before I finish the entire CSS course.

**Thoughts:** I really think these courses are putting me in a position where I'm able to not only effectively use the concepts when coding but also explain them in layman's terms to a potential client or another software developer. And I had a relatively easier experience doing this particular lesson because I now have a better understanding of the material and I'm genuinely enjoying the experience.

### Day 11: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the final two lessons in the **Learn CSS** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com); **Color** and **Typography**. And as such I'm done with the course and I'll be moving onto **Responsive Design**.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing the final lessons of the **Learn CSS**. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I was almost done or the excitement about all the interesting things I was learning about how color and fonts really affect the visual design of the website. I now know that I enjoy using the hexadecimal color system more than the RGB or the named colors. And I'm also quite partial to using sans-serif fonts in my web designs because I feel like they would give my designs a modern aesthetic.

### Day 12: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and did the first lesson on **Sizing Elements**.

**Thoughts:** There was a substantial amount of the material in the course that I already knew. But it was good experience revisiting some of the topics and also learning things from a new perspective. The course also outlined several common design patterns used by professionals when doing responsive design.

### Day 13: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) by doing the final lesson on **Media Queries**.

**Thoughts:** The course gave me a greater understanding of what it's like to design and develop websites that look great on devices of varying screen sizes, resolution and orientation. I'm now better equipped to start developing responsive websites. All I have to do now to master defining breakpoints for media queries in the CSS.

### Day 14: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the **HTML/CSS** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and I finally finished the course.

**Thoughts:** I greatly enjoyed the hour I spent on **freeCodeCamp**. I think I'm going to focus on this particular site for now because I want to finish and get the certifications. I believe certifications of that magnitude may be good for my career. I may still do the courses on **Codecademy** from time to time but for now I'll entirely focus my efforts on **freeCodeCamp**.

### Day 15: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** The decision I made to dedicate more time to **freeCodeCamp** is paying off. I'm really enjoying the exercises and the format in which they're structured. I especially liked how the **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises further clarified the information I already knew about responsive and Bootstrap.
