# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did about 33% of the **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.

### Day 2: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with my refresher course for HTML on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** Through doing this course I've realized that some of the errors that I face with HTML maybe due to things that I thought I really "knew". It's always refreshing to learn more about something that you already thought you knew a lot about.

### Day 3: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 5 topics in the HTML Common Elements lesson on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I would be finished with the HTML course by now but maybe this steady progress I'm making is for the best. The lessons will probably sink in more and I can be more effective in execution of HTML programming. And I think doing a refresher course on HTML is really going to help me when I start learning Bootstrap in earnest.

### Day 4: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Common Elements lesson on Codecademy, which means I'm done with the Elements and Structure course.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely making more progress with this HTML course. And I've realized I'm more effective when I'm in an environment where I can fully concentrate with minimal distractions. This is something I hadn't seriously considered before cause I didn't even consider that my phone could be a serious distraction.

### Day 5: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Tables lesson on Codecademy meaning I'm officially done with the whole **Learn HTML** course.

**Thoughts:** Being done with HTML course means I can now move on to other topics that I also want to do as part of the challenge such as CSS and JavaScript. I'm genuinely happy with what I learnt as part of this HTML course.

### Day 6: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spent 30 minutes on Codecademy doing the **Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules** and then I spent another 30 minutes on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) doing lessons under the **HTML5/CSS** topic.

**Thoughts:** Doing Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp exercises within the same hour was slightly mentally exhausting. And I think I'd be better off dedicating a full hour to each platform.

### Day 7: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the **CSS Setup and Selectors** interactive lesson in the **Learn CSS** course on Codecademy. It was definitely harder than I thought it'd be. Cause I'm actually supposed to know CSS from when I learnt it in university.

**Thoughts:** CSS can be frustrating. I spent about 10-15 minutes trying to figure out how a style is applied to nested elements. I understand the concept better now. But I think I will truly grasp the concept once I've used it a couple of items.

### Day 8: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm starting to grasp & retain a lot of what I'm learning in the CSS course on Codecademy. I finished the **Visual Rules** lesson. And I'm now done with **CSS Selectors and Visual Rules** section and moving on to **The Box Model** section.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the frustration I had yesterday was mostly due to wondering whether or not I would remember and truly be able to implement some of the concepts I was learning cause it seemed like it was quite a lot at one go. But I'm now focusing on just learning the material for now. And then I can put it into practice later when I work on my personal website or other projects.

### Day 9: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the **The Box Model** and **Changing the Box Model** lessons of the **Learn CSS: The Box Model** course on Codecademy. With what I learnt today in the lesson I could quite possibly create my own CSS file for a website. The CSS file will probably consist of the bare minimum elements.

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of the progress I'm making not only in regards to CSS but also with web development in general. Based on what I've learnt so far I can create my own CSS file that follows the principles of modern web development design.

### Day 10: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed the **Learn CSS: Display and Positioning** lesson on Codecademy. And I'm left with only 2 more lessons before I finish the entire CSS course.

**Thoughts:** I really think these courses are putting me in a position where I'm able to not only effectively use the concepts when coding but also explain them in layman's terms to a potential client or another software developer. And I had a relatively easier experience doing this particular lesson because I now have a better understanding of the material and I'm genuinely enjoying the experience.

### Day 11: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the final two lessons in the **Learn CSS** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com); **Color** and **Typography**. And as such I'm done with the course and I'll be moving onto **Responsive Design**.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing the final lessons of the **Learn CSS**. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I was almost done or the excitement about all the interesting things I was learning about how color and fonts really affect the visual design of the website. I now know that I enjoy using the hexadecimal color system more than the RGB or the named colors. And I'm also quite partial to using sans-serif fonts in my web designs because I feel like they would give my designs a modern aesthetic.

### Day 12: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and did the first lesson on **Sizing Elements**.

**Thoughts:** There was a substantial amount of the material in the course that I already knew. But it was good experience revisiting some of the topics and also learning things from a new perspective. The course also outlined several common design patterns used by professionals when doing responsive design.

### Day 13: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) by doing the final lesson on **Media Queries**.

**Thoughts:** The course gave me a greater understanding of what it's like to design and develop websites that look great on devices of varying screen sizes, resolution and orientation. I'm now better equipped to start developing responsive websites. All I have to do now to master defining breakpoints for media queries in the CSS.

### Day 14: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the **HTML/CSS** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and I finally finished the course.

**Thoughts:** I greatly enjoyed the hour I spent on **freeCodeCamp**. I think I'm going to focus on this particular site for now because I want to finish and get the certifications. I believe certifications of that magnitude may be good for my career. I may still do the courses on **Codecademy** from time to time but for now I'll entirely focus my efforts on **freeCodeCamp**.

### Day 15: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** The decision I made to dedicate more time to **freeCodeCamp** is paying off. I'm really enjoying the exercises and the format in which they're structured. I especially liked how the **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises further clarified the information I already knew about responsive and Bootstrap.

### Day 16: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did the **jQuery** section on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** I have never used jQuery before and the exercises in this section were an eye opener. The whole experience made me want to learn a whole lot more about JavaScript and jQuery. I just hope I can use some of what I learnt today in the tribute page challenge.

### Day 17: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** I'm beginning to realize that it's going to be harder than I anticipated to implement the design that I had in mind. The website currently looks nothing like the design. But I'm going to keep working on it until it does.

### Day 18: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Fully immersing myself into the tribute page challenge is teaching me a lot about the things I don't know. And I'm enjoying every minute of it cause it gives me a chance to really improve my skills in whatever concept it is that I don't know. There are times when it gets hard, when the code I've isn't showing the required output. But in those times Google is my friend. Because knowing what error message to research is half the battle when I'm debugging.

### Day 19: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on making the website from the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) a bit more responsive.

**Thoughts:** The responsive design for the webpage isn't coming along the way I would have hoped. But in my efforts I've learned how not to make a responsive design. Hopefully all my efforts won't be to no avail and I'll figure it out soon.

### Day 20: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to try and make the **freeCodeCamp** tribute page more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I thought I would have to go through design changes in order for the website to be responsive. But what I needed to do was tackle the issue from the perspective of the user and their desired user experience. I started using the developer tools in the Google Chrome web browser. The tools helped me a lot in accurately testing how the user interface would look on several devices.

### Day 21: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the CSS media queries for the **freeCodeCamp** tribute page more responsive.

**Thoughts:** When I change the media queries for the website, some of the elements move out of positon when I test on devices of a lower resolution. And I can't seem to get the main image of the webpage to positioned exactly where I want it to appear. I'll probably have to do more research on CSS media queries to see how I can fix it.

### Day 22: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished the **Build a Tribute Page** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Completing this particular challenge took longer than I thought it would. But it was actually better that way because I learnt quite a lot from all the things I did wrong. However, I really want to learn more about responsive design(especially CSS media queries) because I want to get better at it.

### Day 23: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Completing the **Build a Tribute Page** challenge really helped change my overall perspective on web development. And now I'm approaching problems in this new challenge with a whole new different format and some newly acquired skills. I just hope I can learn as much from this experience as I did from the previous one.

### Day 24: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took a break from the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** to work on an Android app that I've

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break from the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge since I wasn't exactly full of ideas as to exactly how my interface should look. And I thought a break would allow the creative juices to start flowing. However, the Android code I thought I would take refuge in wasn't particularly agreeable to my plan and before long my error log was full. But I'll do a bit of research for both situations and figure out some solutions.

### Day 25: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**. I mostly did research on some of the design ideas I had. And I also tried to wireframe these ideas.

**Thoughts:** Wireframing design ideas is an important aspect of any design process but I don't do it as much as I should. And I believe this leads to the final design of an application or website not living up to my initial design expectations. I would probably save myself a lot of trouble if I had design wireframes I can intermittently refer to when I need to clarify my designs during the development process.

### Day 26: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** by wireframing more of the ideas I had.

**Thoughts:** I think I now have greater understanding of how I want the website to look and it's functionality. I'm happy with the design that I now have. It probably needs some tweaks here and there but for now it will have to do. And I can now get back to writing actual code.

### Day 27: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started actively writing code for the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** based on the design that wireframed.

**Thoughts:** I think having a wireframe of the design has really helped with my productivity. Because I now have a plan for everything that I want to do and an idea of how my design will eventually look. And it is also a great reference to remind myself of the many aspects of the design.

### Day 28: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** The portfolio page is coming along quite well. It stills looks far from the design I had in mind. However, I know everything that I have to fix and have an idea of how I'm going to fix it. There is a structure and a definite plan to how I'm doing everything. I want to continue to be this organized when developing projects in the future.

### Day 29: October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**. I definitely had more errors than progress today.

**Thoughts:** The current format I'm following for development is good for identifying bugs early on before they become a problem later. I'll probably still have errors at the end of the process but they'll hopefully be a reduced number. I think as soon as I can get these errors under control I'll hopefully be able to finalize work on this challenge.

### Day 30: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** I had a bit of progress in terms of dealing with errors I had the previous day. At this rate, even if I factor in a couple more error filled days I should be done with the website soon. One problem I realized in today is that I sometimes dwell on code that's not working instead of moving on and then coming back to it with new perspective. It's probably one of the greater hindrances to my productivity.

### Day 31: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Had a productive coding session today. My portfolio has about 7 sections and I have done about 3 so far. I am making steady progress. And I also discovered the Line Awesome icon font. I think the icons would look really great on the website.

### Day 32: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Researched and tried a couple of animations that I wanted to use in the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** I didn't necessarily code but I researched animations that I wanted to use in certain aspects of the website. I could've easily done this at the very end of my development process but I wanted to know beforehand so that I can layout my content accordingly. And I definitely found some amazing examples of how I can give my website an enhanced aesthetic appeal while also improving the user experience.
