# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did about 33% of the **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.

### Day 2: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with my refresher course for HTML on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** Through doing this course I've realized that some of the errors that I face with HTML maybe due to things that I thought I really "knew". It's always refreshing to learn more about something that you already thought you knew a lot about.

### Day 3: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 5 topics in the HTML Common Elements lesson on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I would be finished with the HTML course by now but maybe this steady progress I'm making is for the best. The lessons will probably sink in more and I can be more effective in execution of HTML programming. And I think doing a refresher course on HTML is really going to help me when I start learning Bootstrap in earnest.

### Day 4: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Common Elements lesson on Codecademy, which means I'm done with the Elements and Structure course.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely making more progress with this HTML course. And I've realized I'm more effective when I'm in an environment where I can fully concentrate with minimal distractions. This is something I hadn't seriously considered before cause I didn't even consider that my phone could be a serious distraction.

### Day 5: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Tables lesson on Codecademy meaning I'm officially done with the whole **Learn HTML** course.

**Thoughts:** Being done with HTML course means I can now move on to other topics that I also want to do as part of the challenge such as CSS and JavaScript. I'm genuinely happy with what I learnt as part of this HTML course.

### Day 6: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spent 30 minutes on Codecademy doing the **Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules** and then I spent another 30 minutes on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) doing lessons under the **HTML5/CSS** topic.

**Thoughts:** Doing Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp exercises within the same hour was slightly mentally exhausting. And I think I'd be better off dedicating a full hour to each platform.

### Day 7: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the **CSS Setup and Selectors** interactive lesson in the **Learn CSS** course on Codecademy. It was definitely harder than I thought it'd be. Cause I'm actually supposed to know CSS from when I learnt it in university.

**Thoughts:** CSS can be frustrating. I spent about 10-15 minutes trying to figure out how a style is applied to nested elements. I understand the concept better now. But I think I will truly grasp the concept once I've used it a couple of items.

### Day 8: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm starting to grasp & retain a lot of what I'm learning in the CSS course on Codecademy. I finished the **Visual Rules** lesson. And I'm now done with **CSS Selectors and Visual Rules** section and moving on to **The Box Model** section.

**Thoughts:** A lot of the frustration I had yesterday was mostly due to wondering whether or not I would remember and truly be able to implement some of the concepts I was learning cause it seemed like it was quite a lot at one go. But I'm now focusing on just learning the material for now. And then I can put it into practice later when I work on my personal website or other projects.

**Link to work:** [Day 8 - Codecademy](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/908859593245298688)


### Day 9: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the **The Box Model** and **Changing the Box Model** lessons of the **Learn CSS: The Box Model** course on Codecademy. With what I learnt today in the lesson I could quite possibly create my own CSS file for a website. The CSS file will probably consist of the bare minimum elements.

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of the progress I'm making not only in regards to CSS but also with web development in general. Based on what I've learnt so far I can create my own CSS file that follows the principles of modern web development design.

### Day 10: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I completed the **Learn CSS: Display and Positioning** lesson on Codecademy. And I'm left with only 2 more lessons before I finish the entire CSS course.

**Thoughts:** I really think these courses are putting me in a position where I'm able to not only effectively use the concepts when coding but also explain them in layman's terms to a potential client or another software developer. And I had a relatively easier experience doing this particular lesson because I now have a better understanding of the material and I'm genuinely enjoying the experience.

### Day 11: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the final two lessons in the **Learn CSS** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com); **Color** and **Typography**. And as such I'm done with the course and I'll be moving onto **Responsive Design**.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed doing the final lessons of the **Learn CSS**. I don't know if it had to do with the fact that I was almost done or the excitement about all the interesting things I was learning about how color and fonts really affect the visual design of the website. I now know that I enjoy using the hexadecimal color system more than the RGB or the named colors. And I'm also quite partial to using sans-serif fonts in my web designs because I feel like they would give my designs a modern aesthetic.

### Day 12: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) and did the first lesson on **Sizing Elements**.

**Thoughts:** There was a substantial amount of the material in the course that I already knew. But it was good experience revisiting some of the topics and also learning things from a new perspective. The course also outlined several common design patterns used by professionals when doing responsive design.

### Day 13: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I finished the **Responsive Design** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com) by doing the final lesson on **Media Queries**.

**Thoughts:** The course gave me a greater understanding of what it's like to design and develop websites that look great on devices of varying screen sizes, resolution and orientation. I'm now better equipped to start developing responsive websites. All I have to do now to master defining breakpoints for media queries in the CSS.

### Day 14: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did the **HTML/CSS** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) and I finally finished the course.

**Thoughts:** I greatly enjoyed the hour I spent on **freeCodeCamp**. I think I'm going to focus on this particular site for now because I want to finish and get the certifications. I believe certifications of that magnitude may be good for my career. I may still do the courses on **Codecademy** from time to time but for now I'll entirely focus my efforts on **freeCodeCamp**.

### Day 15: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished all **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** The decision I made to dedicate more time to **freeCodeCamp** is paying off. I'm really enjoying the exercises and the format in which they're structured. I especially liked how the **Responsive Design with Bootstrap** exercises further clarified the information I already knew about responsive and Bootstrap.

**Link to work:** [Day 15 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/911372366940397569)


### Day 16: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did the **jQuery** section on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** I have never used jQuery before and the exercises in this section were an eye opener. The whole experience made me want to learn a whole lot more about JavaScript and jQuery. I just hope I can use some of what I learnt today in the tribute page challenge.

**Link to work:** [Day 16 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/911726290197151746)


### Day 17: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** I'm beginning to realize that it's going to be harder than I anticipated to implement the design that I had in mind. The website currently looks nothing like the design. But I'm going to keep working on it until it does.

**Link to work:** [Day 17 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/912181411406376961)


### Day 18: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** Fully immersing myself into the tribute page challenge is teaching me a lot about the things I don't know. And I'm enjoying every minute of it cause it gives me a chance to really improve my skills in whatever concept it is that I don't know. There are times when it gets hard, when the code I've isn't showing the required output. But in those times Google is my friend. Because knowing what error message to research is half the battle when I'm debugging.

**Link to work:** [Day 18 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/912427665033973760)


### Day 19: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on making the website from the tribute page challenge on [freeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org) a bit more responsive.

**Thoughts:** The responsive design for the webpage isn't coming along the way I would have hoped. But in my efforts I've learned how not to make a responsive design. Hopefully all my efforts won't be to no avail and I'll figure it out soon.

**Link to work:** [Day 19 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/912916810223243265)


### Day 20: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued to try and make the **freeCodeCamp** tribute page more responsive.

**Thoughts:** I thought I would have to go through design changes in order for the website to be responsive. But what I needed to do was tackle the issue from the perspective of the user and their desired user experience. I started using the developer tools in the Google Chrome web browser. The tools helped me a lot in accurately testing how the user interface would look on several devices.

### Day 21: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the CSS media queries for the **freeCodeCamp** tribute page more responsive.

**Thoughts:** When I change the media queries for the website, some of the elements move out of positon when I test on devices of a lower resolution. And I can't seem to get the main image of the webpage to positioned exactly where I want it to appear. I'll probably have to do more research on CSS media queries to see how I can fix it.

### Day 22: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished the **Build a Tribute Page** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Completing this particular challenge took longer than I thought it would. But it was actually better that way because I learnt quite a lot from all the things I did wrong. However, I really want to learn more about responsive design(especially CSS media queries) because I want to get better at it.

### Day 23: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Completing the **Build a Tribute Page** challenge really helped change my overall perspective on web development. And now I'm approaching problems in this new challenge with a whole new different format and some newly acquired skills. I just hope I can learn as much from this experience as I did from the previous one.

### Day 24: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Took a break from the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** to work on an Android app that I've

**Thoughts:** I decided to take a break from the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge since I wasn't exactly full of ideas as to exactly how my interface should look. And I thought a break would allow the creative juices to start flowing. However, the Android code I thought I would take refuge in wasn't particularly agreeable to my plan and before long my error log was full. But I'll do a bit of research for both situations and figure out some solutions.

### Day 25: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**. I mostly did research on some of the design ideas I had. And I also tried to wireframe these ideas.

**Thoughts:** Wireframing design ideas is an important aspect of any design process but I don't do it as much as I should. And I believe this leads to the final design of an application or website not living up to my initial design expectations. I would probably save myself a lot of trouble if I had design wireframes I can intermittently refer to when I need to clarify my designs during the development process.

**Link to work:** [Day 25 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/915400203112517633)


### Day 26: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** by wireframing more of the ideas I had.

**Thoughts:** I think I now have greater understanding of how I want the website to look and it's functionality. I'm happy with the design that I now have. It probably needs some tweaks here and there but for now it will have to do. And I can now get back to writing actual code.

**Link to work:** [Day 26 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/916092060041732097)


### Day 27: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started actively writing code for the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp** based on the design that wireframed.

**Thoughts:** I think having a wireframe of the design has really helped with my productivity. Because I now have a plan for everything that I want to do and an idea of how my design will eventually look. And it is also a great reference to remind myself of the many aspects of the design.

### Day 28: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** The portfolio page is coming along quite well. It stills looks far from the design I had in mind. However, I know everything that I have to fix and have an idea of how I'm going to fix it. There is a structure and a definite plan to how I'm doing everything. I want to continue to be this organized when developing projects in the future.

### Day 29: October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**. I definitely had more errors than progress today.

**Thoughts:** The current format I'm following for development is good for identifying bugs early on before they become a problem later. I'll probably still have errors at the end of the process but they'll hopefully be a reduced number. I think as soon as I can get these errors under control I'll hopefully be able to finalize work on this challenge.

### Day 30: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** I had a bit of progress in terms of dealing with errors I had the previous day. At this rate, even if I factor in a couple more error filled days I should be done with the website soon. One problem I realized in today is that I sometimes dwell on code that's not working instead of moving on and then coming back to it with new perspective. It's probably one of the greater hindrances to my productivity.

### Day 31: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Had a productive coding session today. My portfolio has about 7 sections and I have done about 3 so far. I am making steady progress. And I also discovered the Line Awesome icon font. I think the icons would look really great on the website.

### Day 32: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Researched and tried a couple of animations that I wanted to use in the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** I didn't necessarily code but I researched animations that I wanted to use in certain aspects of the website. I could've easily done this at the very end of my development process but I wanted to know beforehand so that I can layout my content accordingly. And I definitely found some amazing examples of how I can give my website an enhanced aesthetic appeal while also improving the user experience.

### Day 33: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Spent most of my coding session working on the skills and portfolio section of the website. But I really think it's time I finished with this particular challenge. I want the portfolio page to be perfect and I think that's a bit of a hindrance to my productivity. Maybe I should have a deadline so that I can work with a greater sense of urgency.

**Link to work:** [Day 33 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/919113379041677313)


### Day 34: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did some work on my portfolio page; primarily the portfolio section.

**Thoughts:** Continued working on the portfolio section of the portfolio page. The structure I wanted to implemented for the modal boxes wasn't working so I had to do research on how I could do it. I really thought I had designed the structure as simple as possible but judging by errors I'm getting I must be missing something.

### Day 35: October 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on the portfolio section of the website for the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** I almost done implementing the structure I want for the modal boxes in the portfolio section. And I also found a structure for the portfolio section that classifies the projects into different categories; I would like to use this structure on my webpage.

**Link to work:** [Day 35 - freeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/Changamire_Musa/status/919822961514819584)


### Day 36: October 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the portfolio and contact section of my website for the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge from **freeCodeCamp**.

**Thoughts:** Finished implementing the structure for the modal boxes in the portfolio section. And I also started working on the contact section and footer. But I realized at some point I have to work on the typography of the website so that it is consistent throughout.

### Day 37 - Day 41: October 17, 2017 - October 21, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finally made some headway in finishing my portfolio page. I'm officially done with all the sections I wanted to have on the website. I just to need to make it look better and also add content. And I also made a coming soon page which is meant to countdown to the launch of my website.

**Thoughts:** For all intents and purposes I'm done with my portfolio page. I'm just not happy about how I didn't post much about it. But I am happy about the coming soon page that I made. That is the first GitHub repo I have made which isn't associated with a curriculum.

### Day 42: October 22, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Decided to take a break from the **Build a Personal Portfolio Webpage** challenge because I need to figure out how I can enhance the aesthetic appeal of my website. And I worked on building a PHP/MySQL back end for an Android app I have been working on.

**Thoughts:** The process was slightly more challenging than I had anticipated. I had some errors when I tested the RESTful web services using [Postman(REST client)](https://www.getpostman.com/). But I think I can easily debug most of them and Postman will help a lot in that regard. The work I'm doing for this Android app is an ongoing process and I will probably extend it further during a second round of **#100DaysOfCode**.

### Day 43: October 30, 2017

**Today's Progress:** After taking a week long break from the challenge, I decided to get back to it. Spent my session learning about the new features in **Android Studio 3.0**.

**Thoughts:** I took a week long break because I was busy with so much else in my work and personal life. I thought it would be best if I take a break instead of just quitting the challenge. There has been other versions of **Android Studio 3** that were released earlier but I usually wait for the stable version. I believe this the best version for one to get an accurate understanding of the new features in a software.

### Day 44 - 46: October 31, 2017 - November 2, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished my personal portfolio for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).

**Thoughts:** Added all the necessary content and fixed the issues that had previously plagued the completion of the assignment. I am quite satisfied with the final design. However, I've already thought of ideas on how I can improve the website in terms on user intuitiveness, aesthetic appeal and general functionality.

### Day 47: November 3, 2017

**Today's Progress:** My knowledge of Git isn't as it should be so I took some time off from the actual coding to learn more about it. I took a tutorial from [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com)

**Thoughts:** I learnt quite a substantial amount about Git through the tutorial I took on **Code School**. However, I still have a long way to go before I truly master not only Git but version control in general. My ability to understand and effectively utilize particular version control systems will enhance my software development skills and productivity.

### Day 48 - Day 50: November 4, 2017 - November 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Did about half of the challenges in **Basic JavaScript** on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** JavaScript is quite a challenging language to learn but with the way **freeCodeCamp** has structured their content it's much simpler to get everything. The content is concise and very well explained. I actually can't wait to finish the theory challenges and get to the more practical challenges where I have create different projects using JavaScript.

### Day 51: November 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Continued doing challenges in the **Basic JavaScript** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** I'm continually making steady progress in the **Basic JavaScript** section on **freeCodeCamp**. However, I'm left with quite a substantial number of challenges before I finish. Hopefully I'll be done before the end of the week so I can continue with other sections of the **Front End Development Certification**.

### Day 52 - Day 57: November 8, 2017 - November 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed the challenges in the **Basic JavaScript** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** It was really tough sometimes but at least now I have a better understanding of JavaScript. And I tried as much as possible to solve the challenges with little or no help. However, there are some challenges which I had to use the provided hint to complete but at least I understood the concepts.

### Day 58: November 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Spent my coding session on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga). I did all of the challenges in the **Object Oriented & Functional Programming** section. And I also did 2 challenges in the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section.

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy about the progress I made today; because I had set a goal to finish the **Object Oriented & Functional Programming** section and I achieved it. Starting the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section was a great way to end my coding session because it gave me a opportunity to put into practice some of the concepts I learnt today. This will ensure that I fully understand these concepts.

### Day 59: November 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on challenges in the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** I had some difficulty scripting the algorithms. But hopefully I'll get better as I progress.

### Day 60: November 16, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Spent yet another coding session working on challenges in the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** Solving the algorithm challenges has given me a newfound confidence in my ability to use JavaScript effectively. It seems less daunting. I think that's one of the things I've realized through doing #100DaysOfCodes; not everything is as difficult as I had initially thought.

### Day 61 - Day 62: November 17, 2017 - November 18, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Completed the challenges in the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** The whole experience of completing the challenges of the **Basic Algorithm Scripting** section was quite insightful. It gave me a opportunity to understand how to construct programming logic that eventually turns into algorithms and code. Hopefully if I am able to maintain the current pace and dedication I have shown thus far I will attain the Front End Development certification from freeCodeCamp quite soon.

### Day 63: November 19, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Completed the challenges in the **JSON APIs and AJAX** section on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/solomonkamanga).

**Thoughts:** It was a relatively easier section comprised mostly of challenges that are primers for the **Intermediate Front End Development Projects**. I actually might have to use some of the concepts I learnt in this section to make my portfolio website dynamic.

### Day 64: November 20, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** Started on the **Build a Random Quote Machine** challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com).

**Thoughts:** This is the first time I will be using the new concepts I have learnt about JavaScript. I am really excited about putting these newly acquired skills to the test. So far I have started on the overall design of the application. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be finishing up on the design so that I can start implementing and testing the logic.

### Day 65: November 21, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I finished working on the design for the **Build a Random Quote Machine** challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and then I started working on implementing the random quote functionality.

**Thoughts:** I'm glad that I can now quickly put together designs for any particular project that I'm working on. Because I realized I can always improve on the design after I'm done implementing the functionality of the application. And I'm also glad that even though I'm finding this challenge a bit difficult, to a great extent I still know what I am doing.

### Day 66: November 22, 2017 

**Today's Progress:** I'm almost done with the **Build a Random Quote Machine** challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). But unfortunately not all the application's functionalities are working.

**Thoughts:** It's not loading the quotes from the API. I don't particularly know why this error is occurring but I have some ideas. I'll have to do some extensive debugging in my next coding session in order to fix the issue.

### Day 67 - Day 70: November 23, 2017 -  November 26, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished the **Build a Random Quote Machine** challenge from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com). I managed to fix all the errors that I had previously encountered with the application's functionality. I also revamped the design to make the application look better.

**Thoughts:** The application finally loads quotes from an API. This experience taught quite a lot about retrieving data from APIs. I also learnt a bit about how to debug a website when there seems to be no available error messages.

### Day 71: July 27, 2018

**Today's Progress:** After somewhat of a hiatus, I've decided to give #100DaysOfCode another go. Hopefully this time around I'll make it to the finish line. Today I worked mostly on freeCodeCamp. I did the new challenges in the HTML & CSS sections. And I started on the Applied Visual Design section.   

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working on #100DaysOfCode again. It felt good getting back to everything, since for the past few months it's been a struggle trying to find time to actually sit down and code outside of work.

### Day 72 & Day 73: July 28, 2018 - July 29, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Continued working on challenges from the Applied Visual Design section on freeCodeCamp.   

**Thoughts:** This topic allows one to have an appreciation of all the elements that go into designing and ultimately implementing the code that builds a webpage.

### Day 74: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Finally completed the Applied Visual Design section on freeCodeCamp. Learnt about how aspects such as typography, color, animation, graphics along with page layout contribute to a good design. This has helped me understand the structure of visual design that fulfills user requirements and still looks great. 

**Thoughts:** I had a couple of days where I really struggled to find time to work on #100DaysOfCode. But I'm not beating myself about that because I actually ending up making time to another contribution. And I also quite enjoyed the Applied Visual Design section because I learnt a lot. Learning about visual design now puts me in a better place to even critique some of the websites I have done in the past to see how I can improve their design.
