# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did about 33% of the **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.

### Day 2: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with my refresher course for HTML on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** Through doing this course I've realized that some of the errors that I face with HTML maybe due to things that I thought I really "knew". It's always refreshing to learn more about something that you already thought you knew a lot about.

### Day 3: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did 5 topics in the HTML Common Elements lesson on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I would be finished with the HTML course by now but maybe this steady progress I'm making is for the best. The lessons will probably sink in more and I can be more effective in execution of HTML programming. And I think doing a refresher course on HTML is really going to help me when I start learning BootStrap in earnest.

### Day 4: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Common Elements lesson on Codecademy, which means I'm done with the Elements and Structure course.

**Thoughts:** I'm definitely making more progress with this HTML course. And I've realized I'm more effective when I'm in an environment where I can fully concentrate with minimal distractions. This is something I hadn't seriously considered before cause I didn't even consider that my phone could be a serious distraction.

### Day 5: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the HTML Tables lesson on Codecademy meaning I'm officially done with the whole **Learn HTML** course.

**Thoughts:** Being done with HTML course means I can now move on to other topics that I also want to do as part of the challenge such as CSS and JavaScript. I'm genuinely happy with what I learnt as part of this HTML course.

### Day 6: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Spent 30 minutes on Codecademy doing the **Learn CSS: Selectors and Visual Rules** and then I spent another 30 minutes on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) doing lessons under the **HTML5/CSS** topic.

**Thoughts:** Doing Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp exercises within the same hour was slightly mentally exhausting. And I think I'd be better off dedicating a full hour to each platform.

### Day 7: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Finished the **CSS Setup and Selectors** interactive lesson in the **Learn CSS** course on Codecademy. It was definitely harder than I thought it'd be. Cause I'm actually supposed to know CSS from when I learnt it in university.

**Thoughts:** CSS can be frustrating. I spent about 10-15 minutes trying to figure out how a style is applied to nested elements. I understand the concept better now. But I think I will truly grasp the concept once I've used it a couple of items.

### Day 8: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I'm starting to grasp & retain a lot of what I'm learning in the CSS course on Codecademy. I finished the **Visual Rules** lesson. And I'm now done with **CSS Selectors and Visual Rules** section and moving on to **The Box Model** section. 

**Thoughts:** A lot of the frustration I had yesterday was mostly due to wondering whether or not I would remember and truly be able to implement some of the concepts I was learning cause it seemed like it was quite a lot at one go. But I'm now focusing on just learning the material for now. And then I can put it into practice later when I work on my personal website or other projects.

### Day 9: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Completed the **The Box Model** and **Changing the Box Model** lessons of the **Learn CSS: The Box Model** course on Codecademy. With what I learnt today in the lesson I could quite possibly create my own CSS file for a website. The CSS file will probably consist of the bare minimum elements.

**Thoughts:** I'm proud of the progress I'm making not only in regards to CSS but also with web development in general. Based on what I've learnt so far I can create my own CSS file that follows the principles of modern web development design.
