# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress:** I did about 33% of **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.

### Day 2: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Continued with my refresher course for HTML on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** Through doing this course I've realized that some of the errors that I face with HTML maybe due to things that I thought I really "knew". It's always refreshing to learn more about something that you already thought you knew a lot about.

### Day 3 Spetember 9, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Did the 5 topics in the HTML Common Elements lesson on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I would be finished with the HTML course by now but maybe this steady progress I'm making is for the best. The lessons will probably sink in more and I can be more effective in execution of HTML programming. And I think doing a refresher course on HTML is really going to help me when I start learning BootStrap in earnest.
