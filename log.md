# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I did about 33% of **Learning HTML** course on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com).

**Thoughts:** I really thought I was going to do a bit of work on my personal website but I couldnt't find the time. But going forward I really want to supplement what I'm doing on Codecademy with work on my website or any other form of actual coding where I get my hands dirty.
